I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together
Weak or strong, not just a song
We sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall
And I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on
They let me lead you so far
Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm

I see the sickness in the signs
The dead weight in line
Like the sickness in my mind
Homosexuals and liars
Fuck playing for reasons
Fuck playing for Jesus
Let me shine like a god, like a leader
I'll burn a hole through your cross
My soul already lost
And it's funny 'cuz they're saying 'He's hot.'
But they don't see the fucking tears that I've cried
And they don't hear me when I scream when I die
I wanna live good, I wanna live right
My insecurities are eatin' me alive
I need a friend, someone close to my heart
That'll help me through my struggles
You can help me through my times

I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together
Weak or strong, not just a song
We sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall
And I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on
They let me lead you so far
Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm

I already found the devil, he's my best friend
He taught me how to leave, but I don't wanna end
I want a pill for every bad thought
For every chick I fucked
For every time I lost
Don't think I'm broken, 'cuz I'm not
Got milk? Got problems?
Problems is all that I got
You're looking down on a barrel of a bent pole
Take my hand, I promise that I'll go slow
When you looked too close you end up with a broke soul
'Cuz in the end it's certain where all the souls go
Maybe you can show me how to live right
And come see how it all ends wrong

I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together
Weak or strong, not just a song
We sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall
And I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on
They let me lead you so far
Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm

I'll take you to a place so warm
Like the insides of a baby unborn
The bible keeps telling me 'Don't go!'
They don't know what I know, what?
You won't reap what I sew, what?
You won't cease when I blow, yup!
I won't leave when you go, nope!
Come with me, let us go home

I'm supposed to be the one who brings us all together
Weak or strong, not just a song
We sing along when things go wrong
You will need me when you fall
And I will need you when I'm wrong
Tears lead me on
They let me lead you so far
Weak or strong, I'll hold your arm
