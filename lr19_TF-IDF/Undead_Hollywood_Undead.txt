Undead!
Undead!
Undead!
Undead!

(Undead!)
You better get up out the way,
Tomorrow we'll rise so we fight today,
And no, I don't give a fuck what you think and say,
'Cause we are gonna rock this whole place anyway.

Now I see that motherfucker writin' on the wall
When you see, J-3-T,
Thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck those haters I see,
Cause I hate that you breathe,
I see you duck,
You little punk,
You little fucking disease,
I got H.U. tattoed on the front of my arm,
Boulevard,
Brass knuckles in the back of the car,
Cause we drunk drive Cadillac — we never go far,
And when you see us motherfuckers,
Better know who we are.

I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate,
Motherfuckers don't know what,
You better watch what you say.
From these industry fucks,
To these faggot ass punks,
You don't know what it takes,
To get this motherfucking truck.

I'm already loud maybe,
It's a little too late,
Johny's taking hands up, with all the faggots who hate,
'Cause I'm like god, motherfucker, there's a price to pay,
Yeah, I'm a god, motherfucker, and it's judgment day!

(Undead!)
You better get up out the way,
Tomorrow we'll rise so let's fight today,
You know, I don't give a fuck what you think or say,
'Cause we are gonna rock this whole place anyway.

I'm getting used to this nuisance,
And all the fags who bad mouth this music,
It's fuckin stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this,
You cowards can't, never will, don't even try to pursue it.
I took the chance, I played the bill, I nearly died for this music.

You make me wanna run around, pulling my guns out and shit,
Your tempting me to run my mouth, and call you out on this bitch,
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this,
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge,

What? You can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What? You think I just got lucky and didn't work for this shit?
Bitch. I've been working at this ever since I was a kid,
I played a million empty shows to only family and friends.

What kind of person disses a band that deserves to get big?

I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out of the kid's lips.
That shit's as worse as it gets.
This verse is over, I quit.
Signed Charlie Scene on your girlfriend's tits.

White boys with tattoos,
We are pointing right at you,
We are breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom,
Pack of wolves,
'Cause we don't follow the rules,
And when you're running your mouth,
Our razor blades come out,
Because it's nothing in my life except my dick and what I spit,
So my dick is in my hand when I respond to faggots talking shit,
Speaking of fags, already wrap with the drag,
We killed him and then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac.

Why you always pressin?
You know I'm never stressing,
With fucking DMS,
J-Johnny to my left,
Got Phantom and the rest,
Who are down there at the west,
I grew up on drive-by's and L.A gangsta's,

So what the fuck do you know about being a gangsta?
What the fuck do you know about being in danger?
You ain't doing this, so you know you're just talking shit.
Mad at all the boys because every song is a fucking hit.

Motherfucking time to ride, (ride,) (Undead!)
See you drop when we drive by, (by) (Undead!)

Won’t you punks just die, (die) (Undead!)
